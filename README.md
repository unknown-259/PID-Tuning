# PID-Tuning

PID controllers have the takes some error in our system and reduces it to zero. PID control consists of three basic coefficients – proportional(P), integral(I) and derivative(D) – to find optimal response. These parameters can be weighted, or tuned, to adjust their effect on the process. We only used P and D parameters of the PID control, for controlling the motion of a quadcopter.
